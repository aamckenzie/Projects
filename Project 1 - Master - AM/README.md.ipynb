    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a member of the College Board team tracking statewide participation, we will be looking at gathered SAT and ACT data regarding state scores and participation rates accross the United States and seeking to identify how best to adress the factors that we find are influencing them. We will take a particularly close look at the state of Oklahoma which in 2017 had participation rates of 7% with an average total score of only 1047, and saw little improvement in 2018's numbers.\n",

    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to take the provided SAT and ACT data sets from the years of 2017 and 2018, and through the process of exploratory data analysis, clean, organize, and plot the data through Python Pandas to gain valuable insights and a better understanding of how to address the issue of less than ideal SAT participation and performance rates SAT across the country, with a specific focus on Oklahoma. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is displayed using Python's visualization libraries, including Heatmaps, Histograms, Box Plots, and Scatter Plots. Through the use of these visualizations, in combination with outside research, we are able to identify opportunities for College Board to improve average SAT participation rates and total scores in Oklahoma, as well as other struggling states across the us.\n",

    "### Conclusions & Recommendations\n",
    "One of the primary factors hurting SAT participation rates and scores in Oklahoma is the fact that sepcific school districts choose what test to administer. There is no statewide mandate to spend class time specifically prepping for the SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various strategies that other states have deployed to increase participation rates that Oklahoma should consider introducing. These include:\n",
    "- Waiving of the $50 test fee as well as those involved with seeing scorereports. This improves college access for low-income students.\n",
    "- Encouraging students to take the test multiple times.\n",
    "- Allowing same day registration.\n",
    "- Offering the test year round as well as having it take place on a school day, as opposed to the usual Saturday, increases access for lower income students \n",
    "- Setting up a test prep class as part of the high school curriculum (ideally starting in 9th grade). It has been shown that earlier exposure to college prepardness greatly improves student achievement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, states that see large increases in SAT participation rates (especially due to shifting to mandatory testing) often experience a dip in their average scores. This is likely due to selection bias, as there is a sudden inclusion of students who may have only taken the ACT as well as those who were not planning on attending college at all, however additional data on student preparedness is required to be sure. It is important to note, though, that while state averages may initially drop with increased participation, individual student performance increases.\n",
