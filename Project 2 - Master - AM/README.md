# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Problem Statement
---
Q & A Real Estate is looking for a competitive advantage when it comes to competition. They are a small business with the main focus of buying and selling residential homes. Work has been slow for the second quarter in a row and real estate agents are not motivated. Employees are leaving for local competitors to gain higher commissions and increased business. The broker of Q & A properties recognizes the decline in productivity, sales, and valuable customer service and chose to hire me. My analysis of the current market of properties will allow me to build a model to accurately predict the worth of a property. This model has the ability to help not only Q & A Real Estate, but also the buyers and sellers. Q & A Real Estate can eliminate the cost of appraisers to their customers and guarantee the true market value for their property. Real Estate agents will be more enthusiatic to work for a company with cutting edge technology and a higher commission if they come across an undervalued property based on the model.

## Executive Summary
---
Analyzing the Data for Ames housing was a lengthy but impotant step in accurately placing a price on the properties. The original data was obtained directly from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office and is used for tax assessment purposes. In the workflow process I inspected for missing values, removed duplicates, and altered the datatypes to numeric category so that they could be used as input for the value of the properties. Some things I ran into while cleaning the data set was that the data dictionary had ordinal and nominal columns with a value of NA. These were not always null values, but instead represented that the feature was not present in that home. It is important to note that properties with foreclosures or family sale can throw off the model for its intended use. 
Those rows will be removed to create an effective model. Another thing to consider is that this model should be used in the relative area. This data set represents a small sample and may not be applicable in other states such as New York or California where the cost of living is higher.

## Conclusion & Recommendation
---
Q & A Real Estate can turn things around with the model I created! The broker can regain the keenness his staff had when homes were being bought and sold consistently. Q & A can offer a service no other competitor offers and provide a unique hassle free experience that saves the customer not only time but money. Commissions will rise for the broker and real estate agents as they have the model with the true price of properties.

Despite the heteroscedasticity shown in the model, I recommend using Model 3. This model has the strongest test score validated by the cross validation. It is important for buyers and sellers to save and make money. This model provides the best method to guarantee an accurate market value. This model can be improved even more in the future by removing features with weak correlations to price.

The strongest features in relation to sale price were above grade living area, exterior quality of materials, and kitchen quality. The features that hurt the home the most were not having masonry veneer, having a detached garage, and having a cinder block foundation. Home owners can increase the value of their home by improving the kitchen quality, adding a fireplace, and adding a full bathroom. The highest price homes on average are in Stone Brook and the cheapest houses on average are in Meadow V. The median average home by neighborhood cost around $170,000 in Mitchel. For this model to be transparent, it would be helpful to have more information on the income of persons. It needs to be a similar earning per capita to be comparable.
